# Acekard R.P.G

Acekard RPG source code.

See `license.txt` for the license. This is simply a reupload of the last officially released source code. 

This requires devkitARM r20 and a version of libnds from 2007 to be able to build without any changes.

Running `make -s` should build it. Otherwise build each directory in the following order:
	1. libiorpg
	2. libfat
	3. akloader
	4. akmenu4
